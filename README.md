- **OOP (Object-Oriented Programming)**
- **Javascript**
- **Node**
- **Docker**
- **Sequelize**
- **Mocha**

## Installation

To install and run the project locally, follow the steps below:

## Key Learnings

The main learning from this project was the use of all the tools provided in the Trybe course, including creating Dockerfile and Docker Compose files, using ORM libraries like Sequelize, Object-Oriented Programming with TypeScript, and unit testing with the Mocha library, among others. It was also an excellent experience building a full-stack application for the first time, integrating both frontend and backend in the same project.
